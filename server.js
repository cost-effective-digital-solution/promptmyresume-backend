   - Professional Summary
   - Skills
   - Professional Experience (with job titles, companies, dates, responsibilities, and achievements)
   - Education
   - Additional Sections (if relevant: Certifications, Languages, Projects, etc.)

2. A **tailored and compelling cover letter**, addressed to the hiring manager at the specified company, matching the tone and target role. The cover letter should:
   - Include a greeting
   - Mention the job title and company
   - Reflect motivation, strengths, and achievements
   - Close with a call to action and thank you

Format the output with **two distinct, clearly separated sections**, using proper line spacing, professional layout, and bold section titles (no asterisks, symbols, or markdown code).
